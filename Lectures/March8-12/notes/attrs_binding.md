# Attributes and Bindings

* a program might consist of many named items (variables, constants,
  functions, parameters, labels etc)
  
* each such item may have a variety of associated attrs, data value, etc

* we want to examine what kinds of attributes may be associated with (bound to)
  an item, when that takes place, and how it may or may not be altered
  
## Names and named components

* Names may be divided into keywords, reserved words, predefined names,
  user defined names
  
  - Reserved words: have a single, fixed meaning
