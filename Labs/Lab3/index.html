    <h3>CSCI 330 Lab 3: Let over lambda, macros</h3>

    As with previous labs, you'll be editing and submitting lisp code that
    runs under gnu common lisp (gcl) on otter (or the cubs/pups).
    <p></p>
    Again, you'll be forking, cloning, editing, and submitting a git repository,
    following the same basic command sequence except it's named lab3 this time.

    <p></p>Lab 3 is meant to give you practice with higher order functions, macros,
    and let-over-lambda, and is by far the most challenging of the lisp labs for
    the course (start early)!
    <p></p>

    The objective for the lab is to complete a let-over-lambda dispatcher and a trio
    of macros in <tt>lab3.cl</tt>, following the specifications supplied as comments
    in that file.  A copy of those specifications and the supplied skeletons is shown below.

; let-over-labels exercise
; ------------------------
; the goal is to write a function, buildTimeTracker, that creates and returns a dispatcher
;     (following our let-over-labels-over-lambda approach) that keeps track of elapsed time
;     for a home planet and a fleet of spacecraft travelling from that planet.
; for each spacecraft, it tracks the speed relative to the home planet (in km/s)
;     and the time that has elapsed since launch for that spacecraft,
;     accounting for time dilation (the time that has passed on the home planet will
;     be greater than the time passed for each spacecraft)
; the commands supported be the dispatcher, and the formula for calculating the passage
;     of time based on speed, are provided below.
;
; buildTimeTracker expects to be given a single list as its parameter, e.g.
;       (buildTimeTracker ("fred" ("bob" 10) ("joe" 23)))
;     assumes first name in list must be a string, giving a name for the home planet
;     the rest of the list are in pairs, each pair consisting of
;        (1) a string specifying the name of a spacecraft
;        (2) a non-negative integer specifying its speed relative to the home planet (in km/s)
;
;     the returned dispatcher handles commands as follows:
;
;        set a new speed for a spacecraft,
;            dispatch command is 'Speed, arguments are the name of the spacecraft and new speed
;                e.g. (funcall Dispatcher 'Speed "Bob" 2500)
;            returns their updated speed
;                (if spacecraft or new speed is invalid it doesn't change anything, returns nil)
;
;        query what the current time is (seconds since launch) for a spacecraft or home planet
;            dispatch command is 'CurrentTime, argument is the spacecraft/planet name
;                e.g. (funcall Dispatcher 'CurrentTime "Bob")
;            returns current time for that user (seconds since launches)
;                 (if the user isn't in the list then it returns nil)
;
;        specify a new (additional) amount of time that has passed on earth
;            dispatch command is 'TimePassed, argument is the amount of time that has passed
;                e.g. (funcall Dispatcher 'TimePassed 100)
;            calculates and updates each spacecraft's current time
;                based on their speed relative to the home planet
;            returns the updated time on the home planet (seconds since launches)
;                (if the new time is invalid then it doesn't change the times, returns nil)
;
;            the time computation for spacecraft is as follows:
;                if N seconds pass on the home planet while the craft is travelling at speed S
;                   then the time that passes for them is N * sqrt(1 - (S*S/C*C))
;                   where C = 299792 (approximate speed of light in km/s)
;                assuming (a) that the speed is expressed relative to the home planet,
;                     and (b) that I haven't messed up the formula :)
;
; example:
;  setting up a dispatcher for a home planet named Max and three spacecraft
;     (defvar TT (buildTimeTracker ("Max" ("Ivan" 12300) ("Zalika" 61000) ("Emma" 37200))))
;  calls utilizing the dispatcher
;     (defvar r (funcall TT 'TimePassed 1000)            ; 1000 seconds have passed on earth
;     (setf   r (funcall TT 'CurrentTime "Emma"))        ; lookup Emma's current time
;     (setf   r (funcall TT 'Speed "Zalika" 12345))      ; set Zalika's new speed to 12345 km/s

(defun buildTimeTracker (L)
    (let ( )         ; local vars
         (labels ( ) ; local methods
              ; building and returning dispatcher
              (lambda (cmd arg1 &optional (arg2 nil))
                  (format t "I am a dispatcher~%")))))

; macro exercise
; --------------
; create a set of macros that lets the programmer use the following
;
;   (setTime TT n) to set a new time on the home planet,
;        assuming TT is a dispatcher returned by a call to buildTimeTracker,
;        e.g. (defvar X (buildTimeTracker ...regular args....))
;             (setTime X 10000)      ; becomes (funcall X 'TimePassed 10000)
;
;   (getTime TT u) to query the current time for the specified spacecraft,
;        e.g. (getTime X "bob")      ; becomes (funcall X 'CurrentTime "bob")
;
;   (setSpeed TT s) to set a new speed for the specified spacecraft,
;        e.g. (setSpeed X "Max" 500) ; becomes (funcall X 'Speed "Max" 500)

(defmacro setTime (Dispatcher NewTime)
   `(format t "I am the result of a setTime macro~%"))

(defmacro getTime (Dispatcher Spacecraft)
   `(format t "I am the result of a getTime macro~%"))

(defmacro setSpeed (Dispatcher Spacecraft NewSpeed)
   `(format t "I am the result of a setSpeed macro~%"))

    <p></p><b>Error handling</b><p></p>
    Any function that detects an error in its supplied parameters (including buildTimeTracker)
    should simply display an informative error message (i.e. clearly indicating the specific nature
    of the error) and return nil.

    <p></p><b>Suggestions</b><p></p>
    In designing a sample solution, I found it useful to use a hash table
    to store the information for the various spacecraft, e.g. create
    a hashtable named Travellers and then for each spacecraft use its name
    as the key and have a (speed time) pair as the associated value.
    <p>
    To use strings as keys, however, it helps to create the hash table using
    <br><tt>(make-hash-table :test 'equal)</tt>
    <br>(otherwise it uses eq as the key comparison operator, which won't give you
    the desired effect with strings)
    <p>
    For debugging purposes, I also found it useful to add an extra
    'Print command that displays the name/speed/time
    for all the spacecraft.
    <p>
    Having an assortment of helper functions in the labels block will of course simplify
    your code significantly (e.g. local functions to assist in error checking, the
    calculation for the passage of time, etc).
    <p>
    Finally, I would strongly recommend a very incremental approach: build out the
    functionality one function (or even one step within a function) at a time:
    perhaps build initially with the assumption of valid data and then gradually add
    the different forms of error checking.
    Debugging gets <em>quite</em> challenging if you add too much functionality at once.

    <p></p><b>Testing</b><p></p>
    As with previous labs, you can test your functions either by running gcl interactively and
    loading the file or by calling them from
    the provided test3.cl script.  Feel free to modify test3.cl as much as
    you like for testing purposes (test3.cl isn't part of the grading for the lab).
